# openscad-modules
Various custom OpenSCAD modules for stuff that I needed to print.

They are generally printable with a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.16mm layer height. If you have enough wall lines (say, 4) you don't need support or infill unless otherwise noted. Might need to experiment.

- `Labyrinth-Geisthalter.scad` - Socket for cardboard board game tokens. Made with "Das verr√ºckte Labyrinth" in mind and roughly matches these dimensions.
- `M3-Steckschluessel.scad` - An M3 nut driver for bare hands use. Print with 30% infill.
- `wohnwagen-fensterstecker.scad` - A small clip used in some campers to attach curtains to those small trap windows. Print hot for good layer adhesion, 30% infill. Use sturdy material such as ABS or PETG. PLA might not be enough.
- `wall-hole-cover.scad` - Cover plate for 60mm wall holes that usually contain wall plug sockets
